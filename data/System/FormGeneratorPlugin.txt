---+!! Automatically generate forms from multiple sources.

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

---++ Usage

Forms to be generated will be added to a group via a preference. Each group has a set of generators which determine how the form will be generated. The generators may have priorities and can override each other.

During generation the TML in the generators will be expanded. The result should be a valid form table. Below the table may be multiple preferences (to be set with =<nop>   &#42; Set setting = ...=) which will also be added to the form.

Customization can be done by creating extra-rules in the target web.

*NOTE:* You must not use Solr for generating the forms, since it's index is probably not up to date when the generation is taking place.

---+++ Form

The form will be gernerated automatically. Old forms will not be overwritten; delete them and use the index link below, if you want them to be generated.

---+++ !FormManagers

!FormManagers tell the plugin which forms it should generate. They have the same name as the form but =Manager= appended, eg. =DocumentForm= will have the manager =DocumentFormManager=.

Set the group by setting =FormGenerator_Group= as a _preference_ (do not put this into the =%<nop>TEXT%=).

<pre>
   &#42; Set FormGenerator_Group = <i>MyGroup</i>
</pre>

You should also set the =VIEW_TEMPLATE= to =FormGeneratorManagerView=.

If you do not want anyone to make changes to that manager (because it should be updatable), set =FormGenerator_AppControlled = 1= in the manager's preferences (again not in =TEXT=).

---+++ Generators

Again, set any setting as _preference_ and not by putting it into the =%<nop>TEXT%=.

Eg.
<pre>
   &#42; Set FormGenerator_TargetFormGroup = <i>MyGroup</i>
   &#42; Set FormGenerator_SourceTopicForm = <i>FormThatTriggersGeneration</i>
   &#42; Set FormGenerator_Priority = 100
   &#42; Set FormGenerator_Order = -5
</pre>

| *Setting* | *values* | *Meaning* |
| =FormGenerator_TargetFormGroup= | _any text_ | This determines, which group the generator will apply to. |
| =FormGenerator_SourceTopicForm= | _web.topic_ | This setting is optional. When a topic with this form is saved, the generator will be triggered. |
| =FormGenerator_Priority= | _any positive or negative number_%BR%=-1=, =0=, =100= | This is the priority for the rule. Defaults to =0=. Higher priorities win. May be negative. |
| =FormGenerator_Order= | _any positive or negative number_%BR%=-1=, =0=, =100= |  This determines to position in the generated form. Defaults to =0=. Lower value means higher in the generated table. May be negative. |
| =FormGenerator_ExpandMacros= | =1= or =0= | When set to perl-true, macros in the generator will be expanded. Note, that generators outside of [[%SYSTEMWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%][%SYSTEMWEB%]] will need to be white-listed in configure. |
| =FormGenerator_Disabled= | =1= or =0= | Set this to perl-true (eg. =1=) to deactivate this rule. |

---+++ =@REMOVE= and =@REPLACE=

If you set a setting or field type to =@REMOVE=, the field/setting will be removed.

If you just want to replace a field without affecting it's position, set =@REPLACE= as an attribute. Make sure, there is another generator for this field - so there is a field to replace in the first place!

---+++ Customization / =ExtraFields=

You can create extra rules on a per-web and per-form level. They are topics with the form's name suffixed with =ExtraFields= and a number (starting at =1=, consecutive), eg. when you form is called =MyForm=, you might want to create =MyFormExtraFields1= and =MyFormExtraFields2= and so on.

Each extra-rule does have a priority and a position, however no group (it belongs to a form) and no !SourceTopicForm.

---+++ Escapes

There are some special escapes, do make life easier when using the expand macro.

| *Escape* | *Expands to* | *Analog in standard escapes* |
| =@DELAY= | =%= | =$percent= |
| =@QUOT= | ="= | =$quot= |
| =@NOP= | _will be removed_ | =&lt;nop&gt;= |

---+++ AppManagerPlugin

After you have installed an app via AppManagerPlugin, you must manually index all generators. Use any of these links:
   * [[%SCRIPTURL{rest}%/FormGeneratorPlugin/index?generate=1][index and generate with solr (as admin user)]]
   * [[%SCRIPTURL{rest}%/FormGeneratorPlugin/index?mode=nosolr;generate=1][index and generate without solr (as admin user)]]

---+++ Configure

If you want to use =ExpandMacros= in generators outside of your [[%SYSTEMWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%][%SYSTEMWEB%]] web, you will need to add them to ={Extensions}{FormGeneratorPlugin}{allowExpand}=.
